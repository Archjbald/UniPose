# UniPose
We  propose  UniPose,  a  unified  framework  for  human pose estimation,  based on our “Waterfall” Atrous Spatial Pooling  architecture,  that  achieves  state-of-art-results  on several pose estimation metrics.   Current pose estimation methods utilizing standard CNN architectures heavily rely on statistical postprocessing or predefined anchor poses for joint  localization.    UniPose  incorporates  contextual  seg- mentation and joint localization to estimate the human pose in  a  single  stage,  with  high  accuracy,  without  relying  on statistical postprocessing methods.   The Waterfall module in  UniPose  leverages  the  efficiency  of  progressive  filter- ing  in  the  cascade  architecture,  while  maintaining  multi- scale fields-of-view comparable to spatial pyramid config- urations. Additionally, our method is extended to UniPose- LSTM for multi-frame processing and achieves state-of-the- art results for temporal pose estimation in Video.  Our re- sults on multiple datasets demonstrate that UniPose,  with a ResNet backbone and Waterfall module, is a robust and efficient architecture for pose estimation obtaining state-of- the-art results in single person pose detection for both sin- gle images and videos.
